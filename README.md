# Claude Stuff

Things I know and find important to document about Claude (Code).

Some of it perhaps interesting to a wider audience, some of it clearly
subject to my own preferences (see below).

<details>

- Clojure as a primary language I am focusing on
- VSCode as my primary targeted IDE
- GitHub, Docker on the tooling side
- MacOS as my OS, Linux inside containers and remote
