# Tracker API

Tracker exposes a single HTTP API at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/`. Dev port
is `3027`. Request/response bodies are JSON. Use `curl` directly.

Tracker must be running locally (`make start` in `tracker/`) for any of this
to work. Logs at `tracker/logs/tracker.log`.

The same `/api/*` endpoints the UI uses are also the machine-callable
endpoints — what changes is *who* is calling and *whether the recording-mode
gate applies*.

What tracker covers, and how to read and write it well, is the `tracker-user`
skill (plugin `plurama-user`). This skill is the technical side: the endpoint
catalogue, caller identity, auth, and the recording-mode gate.

## Machine-user list reads

For machine-user (bot) callers, list reads on `/api/tasks`, `/api/meets`,
`/api/resources`, `/api/journals`, `/api/journal-entries`,
`/api/recurring-tasks`, `/api/meeting-series` return **lean rows**:
`description` and `tags` are stripped, and the default cap is **100** (not
10). `?detail=full` restores the body text; `/api/today-board` is never
stripped.

For GET reads, encode query parameters in the path query string —
`GET /api/tasks?category=Acme&due-date=2026-06-22&limit=100`. Parameters
placed in a separate body/`query`/`params` field are dropped on a GET, so the
filter and limit silently have no effect and you fall back to the default
capped list. `body` is only for the JSON payload of POST/PUT writes.

## Endpoint catalogue — ask the server

`GET /api/describe` returns a self-description of every public handler
(`{:name :ns :arglists :doc}`); each `:doc` opens with `VERB /api/path — ...`
and lists body fields, query params, views, sort modes, and notable error
cases. **That endpoint is the authoritative reference** — this skill only
covers *how* to use the API (auth, gating, identity, semantics, request
patterns). It does **not** list endpoints, query params, or body fields.
Always consult `/api/describe` for those — never guess from this document
or from memory.

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:3027/api/describe | jq '.[] | {ns, name}'

# Filter to one resource:
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:3027/api/describe \
  | jq '.[] | select(.doc | startswith("POST /api/tasks"))'
```

## Caller identity: regular users vs machine users

Tracker has two kinds of authenticated callers:

- **Regular users** — the human accounts that sign in to the web UI. Writes
  go through with no extra gating.
- **Machine users** — accounts created in admin → Users with the *Machine
  user* checkbox + a target user. They authenticate exactly like a regular
  user, but their JWT carries `is-machine-user: true` and a `for-user-id`
  claim. The server resolves all data access against `for-user-id` (so the
  machine acts on the bound user's tasks, meets, journals, mail, ...), and
  most write requests are gated by recording mode (see below). At most one
  machine user per regular user.

Read access for machine users is unrestricted.

## Authentication

### Dev mode (local)

Bound to `127.0.0.1`. No credentials required. Pick the user with
`X-User-Id`, or omit to target the first user.

```bash
curl -sf -H "X-User-Id: 3" http://127.0.0.1:3027/api/tasks?sort=today
```

In dev mode the recording-mode gate fires only when you send a real
machine-user JWT. The `X-User-Id` path bypasses it.

### Production mode

Every mutating `/api/*` request requires a Bearer JWT.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -sf -X POST http://tracker.example.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"my-machine","password":"s3cret"}' | jq -r .token)

curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://tracker.example.com/api/today-board
```

Admin: `"username":"admin"` + the server's `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## The recording-mode gate

For machine-user callers, mutating requests (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`) are
intercepted before reaching the handler:

- The intent is logged to `tracker/logs/tracker.log` regardless of outcome.
- If recording mode is **ON**, the handler runs.
- If recording mode is **OFF**, the request returns `{"dropped":true}`
  (HTTP 200) and nothing hits the database.

Regular UI users are never gated.

Toggle from inside the UI with **Alt+Shift+W** (or `POST
/api/recording-mode/toggle`). A red REC badge appears in the top bar. The
toggle is **human-only** — agents must not flip it.

### Gate exemptions

Some endpoints are exempt from the gate even for machine users — `POST
/api/messages` (mail inbox ingestion) is the canonical example: mail is
inbox-only noise until the human triages it in the UI, so the gate would
only get in the way of automation. Check `/api/describe` for the
authoritative exemption list per endpoint.

## Common request patterns

### Answering "what's on my today board?"

`GET /api/today-board` returns the aggregate `{tasks, meets,
journal-entries}`. Tasks use the same `:today` filter as the UI's Today
list (incomplete + due-date OR urgent/superurgent OR `today=1` OR
`lined_up_for` set OR active reminder). Meets are those with `start_date =
today` and not archived. Journal entries are today's entries.

### Adding mail to the inbox from a job

`POST /api/messages` bypasses the gate; requires `has_mail` on the (target)
user.

### Creating a task that should appear on Today

Two writes — create the task, then flip its `today` flag — and **both** hit
the gate, so recording mode must be ON for a machine user to land them.
Look up the exact endpoints + bodies in `/api/describe`.
